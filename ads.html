<p style="align:center; font-size:25px; color:white;"> In the modern world, recycling is crucial if we want to preserve the planet for next generations. Since we are creating new items from old, useless ones, it is healthy for the environment. Start recycling at home. You are genuinely recycling if you are using your old products for something new rather than throwing them away.
<br>
Reducing, reusing, and recycling should all be considered while thinking about recycling. It's time to change not only the way we do things but also the way we think because up until this point we have been irresponsible with how we handle the Earth. </p>
